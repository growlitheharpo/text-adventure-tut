This is the dictionary of tile types. Every tile is identified with a seven-digit ID. The meaning of the ID for designers is as follows:
1-3: A three-letter code for the environment of the tile. For example: CAV (cave), URB (urban), FST (forest), etc.

4: Either U, G, or A. U means a unique tile (special loot, special NPC, etc.). G is a generic empty tile, and A is a tile that auto-generates something (such as loot or an NPC).

5-7: Meaning depends on the value of the 4th letter.
U: A hex number (0-f) that serve as a unique ID.
G: A number (0-9) for various generic tiles for that environment.
A: Use the following key:
	000	Totally random loot
	900	Random valuable loot
	G00	Random amount of gold
	Gxx	Amount of gold equal to xx (for more than 99 gold, use a unique tile).
	0M0	Random/generic merchant
	0MW	Random/generic weapons merchant
	0MS	Random/generic supply merchant
	0E0	Random/generic enemy
